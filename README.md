# Weather-App

A sleek and responsive React-based weather application that leverages the **Open-Meteo** API to fetch live weather data—no API key required! Users can search by city to display the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and corresponding weather icons.

##  Features

- Search for any city worldwide to get:
  - **Temperature** in °C (with dynamic thermometer icon)
  - **Humidity** (with icon)
  - **Wind speed** (with icon)
  - **Visual weather icon** that reflects real conditions (clear, cloudy, rain, snow)
- Maintains your preferred UI structure using React state management with `useState`.
- Quick and user-friendly with search-on-click or "Enter" key functionality.
